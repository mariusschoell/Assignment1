                    <h5>Web Applications</h5>
                    <p>  Web applications (reponsive websites) are stored on a remote server and get delivered over the internet through a browser. Web applications are created using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. They provide interaction, navigation or customization capabilities.</p>
                    <h5>Native Applications</h5>
                    <p>Developed for the use on only a specific platform or device, a native app is programmed in a platform-specific programming language .  A native app can only be “native” to one mobile operating systems. Native apps can access all device APIs.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Hybrid Applications</h5>
                    <p>A hybrid app works on multiple platforms. It runs inside a native container and the browser’s engine renders locally. Hybrid Apps are written with the help of web technologies. Device specific interactions will normally be managed by operating system specific plugins. Cross platform apps are slightly different as as the target systems are running a unified API on top of the native SDKs.</p>

            <h2>Cross Platform Mobile Application Development?</h2>
            <p>Cross Platform Mobile Application Development means, that the created apps are compatible with multiple mobile operating systems and can therefore run on any device. The options are, to use a codebase written in an an intermediate programming language and running a unified API on top of the native SDKs (native cross-platform). Or, by building an Hybrid HTML5 app, which uses an almost same code base of CSS, HTML and JS for multiple operating systems. </p>

            <h2>Techniques to develop different types of mobile applications</h2>
            <p>Web applications are usually written using HTML5 for the structure, CSS for the style and JavaScript for the functionality. Often used frameworks for responsive web design are Bootstrap, Cascade etc. Frameworks for the applications itself are for example meteor, rails or laravel.<br>
            Native applications are done in an operating system specific programming language. For Android it is Java and for iOS devices it can be Swift or Objective-C. 
            <br>Other important programming languages concerning mobile app development that are worth considering are Python, Corona, Ruby etc.. 
            <br>Frameworks like React Native and Flutter allow the development of cross-platform mobile apps, using an intermediate programming, mostly JavaScript, and libraries like React.
            <br>Hybrid applications use a hybrid framework (f. e. Apache Cordova, Ionic or Appcelerator Titanium). </p>

            <h2>The main advantages and disadvantages of different types of mobile applications</h2>
            <h3>Native Applications</h3>
            <p>Native apps are suitable for the operating system they are developed for. A smooth interaction with device features and APIs is given. Visual elements are stored in device memory. Apps requiring a high level of optimisation for stable work or native UI and graphic animation should be native. <br>The code is platform-specific. Maintenance of the app will be higher according to the number of platforms used. That is why they are the most expensive ones to develop.</p>
            
            <h3>Hybrid Applications and Cross-platform Applications</h3>
            <p>The cost of hybrid or cross-platform apps is relatively low, but high skills for development tools are required. Some device APIs can be accessed but the experience is not always smooth. Most of the codebase is applicable to major platforms, so maintenance cost is lower.  Further adjustments for the separate platforms are necessary.<br>Hybrid apps are dependent of the web view performance and therefore not suitable for apps with high performance requirements. Though, when done in a decent way users are not able to tell the difference between a hybrid and a native app.</p>
            
            <h3>App Store Benefits for Native and Hybrid / Cross-platform</h3>
            <p>Native and hybrid applications enjoy app store benefits, like marketing. Users can download the app directly to their device, giving it more visibility and more frequent users.<br>App store benefits are closely linked to device benefits, like interaction and push notifications. Those help the user to develop a regular app-using habit.<br>But owners need to have the app store fees in mind, together with the initial deployment fee.</p>
            
            <h3>Web Applications</h3>
            <p>Web applications have the lowest development cost due to a single codebase. Performance depends on browser and network connectivity. There are no app store benefits, but also no restricitons. Monetarization is limited to subscriptions and advertisements. Developers are limited when using APIs, but browser functionality increases. UX is not native. Users will only access the website when necessary. </p>
            
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>The decision on which type of application is the most suitable one is dependent on the requirements of the application. <br>Developers have to decide on the effort they want to put into code portability and maintenance and how important a native experience and app store benefits are. Cost is also an important factor. Considering the type of the app and the user preferences is also very important.</p>

                    <p>Starting point is the design and development of the website on the computer screen and only when that is finished, the mobile view gets important. Responsive web design is a dynamic behaviour of the completed product, meaning that the website or web application is able to adapt to the used device both in functionality and design.</p>

                    <h3>Mobile First Approach</h3>
                    <p>Vice versa, mobile first means designing and implementing a web experience for mobile devices before adapting it to the desktop experience. Starting point is the mobile view and therefore both functionality and design is optimized for mobile use.</p>
